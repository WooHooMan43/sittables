# Sittables

    Love Minecraft but hate standing all the time? Now you don't have to! This is a datapack that adds chairs and other things to sit on to Minecraft.

## Current Sittables

    - Stair-Chairs of all different wood types
        - Acacia
        - Birch
        - Crimson
        - Dark Oak
        - Jungle
        - Oak
        - Spruce
        - Warped

## How do I make them?

    - Stair-Chairs
        A simple line of sign-stair-sign creates the stair-chair of that wood type (wood types cannot be mixed).

## How do I place them?

    - Stair-Chairs
        Simply place the chair facing the place you want the chair to go. The chair will be rotated towards you, so stand in front of the direction you want it to face.

## How do I get rid of them?

    - Stair-Chairs
        Simply break the stair potrion of the chair and the chair will remove itself.
